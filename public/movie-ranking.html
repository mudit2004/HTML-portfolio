        <h3>Spirited Away</h3>
            <p>Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away (Released Date : 12 December 2002 ) is a work of magic that you shouldn't miss. It is an unforgettable, thrilling and enchanting anime movie. Easily one of the best movies I've ever watched and the best movie in Studio Ghibli. Studio Ghibli is from Japan, and there are many movies from it like Howl's Moving Castle, War Of The Fireflies, Whisper Of The Heart, and My Neighbour Totoro.  You will definitely love Spirited Away if you are an anime fan. Even if you hate anime, you need to watch this masterpiece.</p>
            <p>The genre of Spirited Away is Fantasy, Adventure, and Mystery. The main meaning of the movie is that you should never forget who you are.  This movie is for everyone to watch, or anyone who needs a movie to watch. The main character, Chihiro, (Rumi Hiiragi) is a brave, kind, and caring 10 year old girl.  Her mother and father take her to an abandoned amusement park. After both her parents are turned into pigs, Chihiro is lost in a spiritual world and she is helped by Haku, (Miyu Irino)  who gives her pills that keep her in human form.  The animation is amazing with Chihiro's expressions and emotions. Spirited Away has won awards like Academy Award For Best Animated Features, Critic's Choice Movie Award for Best Animated Feature, and the Golden Bear Award. All of the music in the movie is really smooth and calm to listen to. You should definitely listen to One Summer's Day, Always With Me, and A Road To Somewhere.</p>
            <p>Spirited Away has many lessons to it, like that you should be brave, and the only way to get anywhere in life is to work hard. The characters have different abilities. For example, there is a character called No-Face, and he can gain emotions and physical traits from people. Spirited Away is a wonderful movie and I definitely recommend this movie if you don't have any movies to watch and if you haven't watched it yet.  I would give Spirited Away 5 stars out of 5! It was catchy, full of suspense, and humorous. Watch the movie, it is truly worth your time, and you will be… Spirited Away. ♥ </p>    
        <h3>Ex Machina</h3>
            <p>Alex Garland's directorial debut is a stylish sci-fi flick that shows just what happens when men try to play God. The '28 Days Later' writer brings Domhall Gleeson, Oscar Isaac and Alicia Vikander together in this high-tech feature that plays like a loose adaptation of 'The Tempest'. Spanning over 108-minutes, 'Ex Machina' marks A24's first Academy Award for Visual Effects, winning over films like 'Mad Max: Fury Road' and 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens', the latter happened to feature both Isaac and Gleeson also.</p>
            <p>'Mother!' star Domhall Gleeson gives a strong performance, starring as ingenuous programmer Caleb Smith. When Caleb is chosen to stay with Nathan Bateman (a narcissistic, reclusive CEO brought to life by a notable performance from Oscar Isaac), he soon discovers the purpose of his stay is to test a ground-breaking new AI known as 'Ava'. Ava is played by 'Tomb Raider' star Alicia Vikander, who's performance as the synthetic humanoid is both chilling and inquisitive. However, as Ava becomes increasingly conscious and her bond with Caleb grows, her path to freedom is progressively fuelled by deception and manipulation, leading to fatal consequences. </p>
            <p>'Ex Machina' explores the divide between technology and man, Garland shows viewers that when powerful men try to play God, more often than not, it ends in chaos, as shown in films like 'I, Robot' and 'Avengers: Age of Ultron'. Despite its futuristic aesthetic, the film appears to draw influences from past theatrics like Shakespeare's 'The Tempest' as well as Greek Tragedy theatre, as shown by the various masks placed along the wall in Nathan's home. Even the film's title draws from historic theatre, 'Ex Machina' being derived from the Latin phrase 'Deus ex Machina' which means 'a god from the machine'. The film also goes down the path of exploring the fact that artificial intelligence can be seen as evolution, in response to Caleb asking about why Nathan created Ava he responds “I don't see Ava as a decision, just an evolution”. This haunting realisation shows how in the future humans could be seen as obsolete as AI becomes more and more developed and aware.</p>
            <p>The present day setting of 'Ex Machina' allows Garland to show viewers just how close we could be to something like Ava existing, and the possible ensuing disaster coming to fruition. Rob Hardy's sleek cinematography and Mark Digby's contemporary production design, provides the film with ultra-modern visuals that reflect the technology-focused plot. Considering the film only had a $15 million budget, 'Ex Machina's visuals effects are spectacular, and the fact it beat out its competitors, all of which had budgets of over $100 million,, makes it that much more impressive. The film also brings up the issue that whatever you search online is watched, recorded and stored. In 'Ex Machina's case, the trillions of searches help Nathan to develop Ava and create her persona. </p>
            <p>Alex Garland brings viewers a polished sci-fi drama that features strong performances from all three main characters, sleek set design and a superb script courtesy of Garland himself. 'Ex Machina' is a triumphant first outing in the director's chair for Garland, who's film leaves you on the edge of your seat by the time the credits roll.</p>
